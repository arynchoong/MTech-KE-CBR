Pat the beef fillet with kitchen paper to dry it of any blood then season with salt and then heavily with black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan until very hot then spend 8-10  searing and turning the fillet with tongs until it’s well browned on all sides. Hold it up to sear both ends as well. Set the beef aside on a tray to catch any juices and turn the heat off the pan but don’t clean it.\nDrain and squeeze out the dried porcini but reserve the juice and tip the porcini into a food processor with the other mushrooms and thyme. Season everything with salt and pepper and pulse until finely chopped but not completely smooth.

Turn the heat up and tip in the mushrooms, add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and cook everything for 10-12  until you have a paste that comes away from the side of the pan. Tip into a bowl to cool, stir through the parmesan if using and set aside. Turn off the heat from the pan but don’t clean it. The beef can be seared and the mushroom mixture can be made several hours in advance.\nFor the first stage of assembly get a large sheet of cling film and overlap the prosciutto slices on it in a row, tip the mushroom mix on top then cover with another sheet of cling film. Either with your hands or a rolling pin, pat it down or roll it out to a thin layer that just covers the prosciutto. Remove the top sheet of cling film and sit the fillet down the centre of the mushrooms. Using the edge of the cling film lift and roll the prosciutto and mushrooms to encase the beef then use the cling film to roll everything into a tight sausage. For the best results now place the sausage in the freezer for 30  to firm up – do not leave for longer of cooking times will be affected.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry to a rectangle a little larger than a magazine, trim the edges to neaten and save the trimmings. Lightly brush the pastry all over with beaten egg. Carefully unwrap the prosciutto parcel and lay in the middle of the pastry. Like wrapping a parcel or making a spring roll fold the shorter edges over the fillet then roll the whole thing around the fillet to encase. For a really neat finish get another clean sheet of cling film and roll the Wellington into a sausage tight sausage again. Place in the fridge and chill for at least 30  or up to a day.\nHeat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a sturdy, lightly oiled baking tray in it. Re-roll the pastry trimmings and use to make 6 leaves. Unwrap the Wellington, brush all over with egg then decorate with the leaves. Brush the leaves with more egg. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and transfer, sealed side down to the heated baking tray. Bake the for 10  then reduce the heat of the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and continue to bake for 25  for rare meat, 30  for medium rare, 35  for medium and about 45  for well-done, making sure the pastry doesn’t burn (you can cover it with foil if it starts to become too dark. Remove from the oven and leave for 10  to relax.\nTo make the gravy, heat the butter in the mushroom pan and fry the shallot, thyme and bay, scraping the crispy bits of the pan with a wooden spoon. Scatter over the flour and brown then splash in the brandy, sizzle for a minute, then add the red wine and boil to a purple paste. Pour in the mushroom soaking liquid, avoiding the gritty bits at the bottom, crumble in the stock cube and any juice from the resting beef and simmer for 5  until you have a tasty gravy, season to taste.\nUsing a very sharp knife carefully carve the Wellington into 6 thick slices.
